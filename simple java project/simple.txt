Got it! You want the project to also **show the student(s) who scored a specific marks**. Here's the updated **project content** you can give to an AI:

---

Create a simple Java console-based project called **SimpleStudentRankManager** that connects to a **MySQL database**. The project should allow:

1. **Adding a student** with **Name**, **Roll Number**, and **Marks** into a MySQL table called `students`.
2. **Viewing all students** stored in the database.
3. **Ranking students** by **Marks** from highest to lowest using a **Comparator**.
4. **Searching students by specific marks** and displaying all students who scored that marks.
5. Run entirely in the **terminal** (no GUI required).

**Requirements:**

* Use **JDBC** to connect to MySQL.
* Include a **Student class** to store student data when fetching from the database.
* Implement methods: `addStudent()`, `viewStudents()`, `rankStudents()`, `searchByMarks()`.
* Use **ArrayList** and **Comparator** for sorting.
* Include **menu-driven interaction** in `main()` to repeatedly choose options:

  1. Add Student
  2. View Students
  3. Rank Students
  4. Search by Marks
  5. Exit
* Include comments explaining each part.
* Assume MySQL database is `studentdb` with table `students(id INT AUTO_INCREMENT, name VARCHAR(50), roll_no VARCHAR(20), marks INT)`.

If you want, I can make a **fully ready-to-run Java code** for this exact version with the **search by marks feature** included. Do you want me to do that?
you have to carr5e this project with simple and craetethe struvutrure your own\
